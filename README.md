# Deepfake Audio Dataset - 5,000 Audio
Dataset contains **5,000** audio files, comprising both authentic **human recordings** and synthetic** AI-generated voice** samples. It designed for advanced research in **deepfake detection**, focusing on detecting fake voices and **generated speech analysis**. Specifically engineered to challenge **voice authentication systems**, it supports the development of robust models for real vs fake human **voice recognition**. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/real-vs-fake-human-voice-deepfake-audio/?utm_source=github-nlp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=real-vs-fake-human-voice-deepfake-audio)**
